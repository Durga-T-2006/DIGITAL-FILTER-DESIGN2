DESCRIPTION OF TASK-4:As part of the CodTech internship program, Task 4 was to design and simulation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter. The objective of this task was to understand the theory and

practical implementation of FIR filters, which are fundamental components in digital signal processing (DSP) systems. I chose to implement and simulate the filter using MATLAB, which provides various tools for

designing, analyzing, and visualizing digital filters.

Objective:

To design a digital FIR filter using defined specifications and simulate its performance using MATLAB. The task focused on understanding filter coefficients, frequency response, and the behavior of the filter in

both time and frequency domains.

FIR Filter Overview:

A FIR filter is a type of digital filter with a finite duration impulse response, meaning it settles to zero in finite time. It is inherently stable and does not require feedback loops. FIR filters are commonly

used for tasks such as noise reduction, signal shaping, and system identification.

Design Approach:

Using MATLAB, the following steps were followed for filter design and analysis:

Signal Filtering and Simulation:

A test signal containing multiple frequency components was generated. The FIR filter was applied to this signal using the filter() function. The results showed effective attenuation of undesired frequencies while

preserving the desired signal characteristics.

Performance Analysis: The FIR filter provided a linear phase response, preserving the waveform shape of filtered signals.

The attenuation in the stopband was satisfactory, confirming the filter's effectiveness.

MATLABâ€™s visualization tools helped confirm the frequency selectivity and validate that the filter met the design specifications.

Outcome:

This task provided hands-on experience in FIR filter design, implementation, and evaluation. It deepened my understanding of DSP concepts and enhanced my skills in using MATLAB for signal processing applications.

The task demonstrated how theoretical filter design translates into practical performance and laid a foundation for more complex DSP applications.

Tools Used: MATLAB (for design, simulation, and analysis)

MATLAB DSP Toolbox functions: fir1, filter, freqz, impz, stepz
